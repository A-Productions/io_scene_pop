io_scene_pop
============

An addon for importing levels from the games

* Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
* Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within
* Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones

into Blender. Before import, `.bin` files have to be extracted from the `prince.bf` archive using *PersianRug*, which in turn have to be decompressed using *jadepack*. This addon can then import the decompressed `*_wol_*` and `*_wow_*` files using the appropriate menu entry.
